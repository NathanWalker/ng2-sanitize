### Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this seed:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

It will start a local demo server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm run watch`

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`

#### 2. End-to-End Tests (aka. e2e, integration)

* single run:
  * in a tab, *if not already running!*: `npm start`
  * in a new tab: `npm run webdriver-start`
  * in another new tab: `npm run e2e`
* interactive mode:
  * instead of the last command above, you can run: `npm run e2e-live`
  * when debugging or first writing test suites, you may find it helpful to try out Protractor commands without starting up the entire test suite. You can do this with the element explorer.
  * you can learn more about [Protractor Interactive Mode here](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#testing-out-protractor-interactively)

## Documentation

You can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/)) for your code with the following:
```bash
npm run docs
```

* Please rebase your branch against the current master
* Please ensure that the test suite passes **and** that code is lint free before submitting a PR by running:
 * ```npm test```
* If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behaviour
* Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-library-seed/issues) on PR comment
